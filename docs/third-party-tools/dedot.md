# Dedot

Dedot is the next-generation JavaScript client for Polkadot-SDK based blockchains. 
Designed to elevate the dapp development experience, Dedot is rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight and tree-shakable, offering precise Types and APIs suggestions for individual Substrate-based blockchains and ink! Smart Contracts.
Dedot also helps dapps efficiently connect to multiple chains simultaneously as we head toward a seamless multi-chain future.
